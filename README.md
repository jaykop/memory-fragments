# Memory Fragments - The Last Witness

A mystery thriller visual novel game with reverse chronological storytelling.

## Game Overview

**Genre**: Mystery Thriller Visual Novel  
**Platform**: PC (Godot Engine)  
**Play Time**: 7-8 hours

## Story

Detective Lee Jun-hyuk wakes up on an abandoned building's rooftop with no memory. A bloodied gun in his hand, a body at his feet. As sirens approach, he must piece together the truth by traveling backwards through his memories.

The game starts at Chapter 5 (the ending) and progresses in reverse chronological order through Chapter 1 (the beginning), revealing the truth piece by piece.

## Core Gameplay Systems

### 1. Clue Collection
Investigate scenes to collect evidence:
- Physical evidence (weapons, documents)
- Digital evidence (messages, call logs)
- Testimonies (important dialogue information)
- Observations (scene contradictions)

### 2. Memory Connection (Deduction Board)
At the end of each chapter, place collected clues on a timeline and connect related evidence. When contradictions are found, solve deduction puzzles to unlock new clues.

### 3. Trust System
Your deduction accuracy affects the trust meter:
- 80%+: True ending conditions met
- 50-79%: Normal ending
- Below 50%: Bad ending

### 4. Evidence Presentation
Ace Attorney-style moments where you must present the right evidence from your inventory during conversations.
